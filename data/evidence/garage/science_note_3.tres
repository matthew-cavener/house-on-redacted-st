With these, I should be able to boost the volume of the signal and maybe even reach the place of origin for this strange phenomena. I only have two of these devices, so I’ll have to find which rooms to put them in... Luckily, I don't need one in [—————] which is just as well since it pains me too much to go in there these days. 

With any luck, maybe I’ll see her again soon. "
