description = "After a lot of research, I’ve discovered the source of the “Melody’s Melodies” broadcast. I don't understand exactly how, but it corresponds to a strange phenomena which only occurs here, at this house. I’ve been able to study it through this device. 

The phenomena doesn’t behave like radio waves, electromagnetism or anything I’ve seen before, so I’m calling it the 'signal' until I think of a better name. Interestingly, every room registers a different 'volume' of this signal. Maybe that's important to unlocking its source?"
