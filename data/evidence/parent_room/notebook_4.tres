description = "I can't believe it! Years after Grace disappeared into thin air, I turn on the TV and what do I find on channel seventeen? A full cartoon production of Melody's Melodies: the show she 'dreamed' up!

At first I thought someone stole her idea and made it into a show themselves, but then I discovered that the studio who made this show doesn't exist. Nor do the actors, the writers, director-- anybody! It gets stranger because I asked my colleagues at the bank, my neighbors, and family from out of state: no one gets this program but this house. It's like it's being beamed directly to this set, and no where else. I have to study this!"
