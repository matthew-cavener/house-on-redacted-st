You’re looking for a 'lost' show? That’s fascinating, but unfortunately I've never directed any cartoons. During the 50s when that 'Melody' show would have been produced, I had a gig running photo shoots for a very sweet (haha!) project. That seems like a lifetime ago compared to directing the highest grossing flick of 1963."
