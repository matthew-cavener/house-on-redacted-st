description = "You’re looking for a “lost” show? That’s fascinating, but unfortunately I haven't directed any cartoons before. During the 50s when that Melody show would have been produced, I had a gig doing photo shoots for a very sweet (haha!) project. That seems like a lifetime ago compared to directing the highest grossing flick of 1963."
